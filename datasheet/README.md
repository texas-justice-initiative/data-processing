# [Datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) for the TJI data sets

Currently there is no standard way to identify how a dataset was created, and what characteristics, motivations, and potential skews it represents. To begin to address this issue, we attempt to create a short document to accompany the TJI datasets. This will establish better data governance, enable better communication between TJI and dataset users, and provide greater transparency and accountability.

A datasheet consists of the following sections:
- Motivation
- Composition
- Collection process
- Pre-processing/cleaning/labeling
- Uses
- Distribution
- Maintenance

As of March 2020, the goal is to create a datasheet for the death in custody (DIC) dataset first, and handle the other two datasets later since information will overlap between the datasets. The goal is also to **automate** the datasheet generation process especially regarding the composition whose details such as data size and distribution may change every time the data set is updated.
